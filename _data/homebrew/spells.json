            "When you cast this spell, you stab a black, ritualistically-prepared human heart. The ichor from the heart infects the land with foul necromantic energies, causing up to one hundred piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within a 1-mile radius to rise from the dead, becoming {@creature skeleton|MM|skeletons} or {@creature zombie|MM|zombies} (the GM has the creatures' game statistics). The undead dig their way out of graves, smash their way out of mausoleums, and tear down cemetery gates.",

Only one general command can be issued to the undead every 24 hours. If not issued a command, the undead indiscriminately attack living creatures, other than the creature that is holding the heart and creatures designated by it. Once given an order, the undead continue to follow it to the best of their ability until the task is complete.",

The spell ends if the heart is destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, immunity to necrotic, poison, psychic damage) or targeted by a dispel magic spell cast as a 9th level spell. When the spell ends, all undead animated by it are instantly destroyed, crumpling into a heap. The spell also ends if every undead created by it is destroyed."
