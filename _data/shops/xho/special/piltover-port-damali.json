			"This wand is made of wood and looks like the handle of a marionette. The wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to attach a number of magical strings equal to the charges spent to a humanoid that you can see within 60 feet of you. You can attach 1 string to each of the creature's limbs, including its head. For example, a humanoid with two legs, two arms, and only one head could have a maximum of 5 strings attached to it. The strings are {@condition invisible}, but can be seen by a creature with a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Dealing 10 slashing damage with a magical weapon attack to one of the strings (AC 10) causes it to detach and disappear. At the end of each of its turns, a strung creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free of and destroying any number of the strings connected to it on a success. The strings break early if the creature is more than 100 feet away from you.",

On a failed save, the action, attack, check, or saving throw fails and is lost. If an action requires multiple arms and only one of the creature's arms has a string attached, it makes this saving throw with advantage. If the strung arm is holding a shield, the creature doesn't gain the benefits of holding it for the duration. In addition, you can use an action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, dropping any number of items it's holding with the strung arms or hands on a failure."

Poor man had lost his wife in the fire and could surely use the distraction. He got up and joined the bearded man, taking careful and deliberate steps across the room. I took his empty glass to wash and refill with water for when he returned to his seat at the bar.",

				"\"Hey, hey, now, be careful over there. If you fall, I ain't gonna nurse you back to health, ya hear?\" I called over.",
				"The man ignored me and held the stick up to the air. He shouted. They weren't words, but they might have seemed like them to drunkard.",
				"Nothing happened.",
				"He tried again, saying similar words but with more saliva. Again, nothing happened. Frustrated, he stared at the stick before turning his attention back to the cup in his other hand. He took a deep swig to empty it. Some of the drink dribbled down his mouth and into his beard.",
				"\"Gthinkra shtenickken!\" he shouted once more, and this time made a wild flourish with the stick. I opened my mouth to shout back at the man, but the ground suddenly began to buckle and swell beneath my feet. Spoons and other silverware fell to the ground began to clatter against the floorboards. The poured drinks at the bar jostled and rippled, knocking against the polished surface and splattering their contents from side to side.",
				"I held onto the bar, as did the two other men sitting there with me. We watched in disbelief as the man known as Talyard calmly stepped down from the table looking satisfied, and held the stick out to Jinn."
